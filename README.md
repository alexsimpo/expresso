# Expresso

## Project Overview

A capstone project, where I built all of the routing and database logic for an internal tool for a coffee shop called Expresso.
All html and css were provided. 

Which allows users to:
- Create, view, update, and delete menus
- Create, view, update, and delete menu items
- Create, view, update, and delete employees
- Create, view, update, and delete employee's timesheets
